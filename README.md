JugglePro

Long time jugglers may recognize the name. JugglePro was developed way back around 1990 when I was an undergrad at University of Missouri - Rolla. The program was developed in Turbo Pascal on my dad's old IBM.

I've decided to start an open source project for the new improved JugglePro, written in Javascript and utilizing the awesome high-speed graphics library, Pixi.js.

This is going to be something like-minded programmers/jugglers can contribute to which could make this open source the best juggling pattern animator ever!

[JugglePro](http://edcarstens.github.io/JugglePro/) is a 3D pattern viewer based on an extended multi-hand notation (MHN+). The extension allows for true multiplexing.
