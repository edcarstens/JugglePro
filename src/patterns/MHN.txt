// MHN (Multi-Hand Notation)
// MHN is a 2D matrix of hand/throw pairs. Each row of the matrix is a list of
// throws that a particular hand is to make in the juggling pattern. A column
// corresponds to a time at which throws occur. The hand/throw pair tells the
// hand the destination of the ball. It specifies the destination hand, which
// could even be the same hand, and the destination time (obviously a future
// time). It is up to the person controlling the hand to make the proper throw
// to make this happen. Accurate throws are crucial to juggling.

// MHN+ (Multi-Hand Notation extended to support multiplexing)
// MHN+ is a 3D matrix of hand/throw pairs. Instead of allowing only one ball
// to be thrown at a time from a hand, multiple balls are allowed. This adds
// a third dimension to the matrix called multiplex slot. For example, suppose
// you are holding two balls in one hand. Then the MHN+ matrix would be
// [[[ [0,1], [0,1] ]]].
// If you hold two balls in each hand, another row is used to represent the
// other (right) hand:
// [[[ [0,1], [0,1] ]],
//  [[ [1,1], [1,1] ]]]
// Now suppose you juggle all four balls in a synchronized fountain.
// [[[ [0,2], [0,0] ]],
//  [[ [1,2], [1,0] ]]]
// The hand/throw pairs with 0 throw-height can be discarded now. That makes
// sense because this is no longer a multiplex pattern, so there should be no
// need for multiplex slots.
// [[[ [0,2] ]],
//  [[ [1,2] ]]]
//
// Phases, Rows, and Hands
// So what if you juggle four balls in an asynchronous fountain? In this pattern,
// your hands never throw at the same time, they alternate throws. How is this
// going to be notated? We could insert those ugly zero-throw-height pairs if
// forced to represent each hand with a row. But this is not only ugly, it is
// wasteful. We are all for simplification here. So what if the pattern consists
// of just one row and this row now corresponds to both hands. The two hands
// share the row (alternating each column) and agree on which hand goes first.
// Naturally, the destination hand becomes a function of time as well as
// the row, so it is a bit harder to figure out how to make each throw.
// But look how simple our pattern becomes now!
// [[[ [0,4] ]]]   (with 2 phases)
// Yes, we changed the 2's to a single 4. It would be very hard to juggle this
// pattern with only one hand. Thankfully, God gave us two. 
// This is a simple of example of a multi-phase pattern, in this case there are
// two phases, one for each hand. But if you juggle with someone else, you now
// have four hands and could have four phases.  Or, if you like you can have
// three phases. You just have to agree on an order and then figure out where
// each throw must go to execute the pattern. Oh, the possibilities!
